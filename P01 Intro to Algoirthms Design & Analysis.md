# P01 Intro to Algoirthms Design & Analysis

## Sorting Problem

There are several bad algorithms:

- Bogosort: randomly generate permutation and check.
- Bozosort: random swap and check.
- Worstsort: Deterministic but heavily recursive

Sort a list of elements.

A common theme is trade-off of memory and speed.

## Prerequisites:

Asymptotic notation: O(n^2), omega, theta
